Review
Great job! By thinking about functions as data and learning about higher-order functions, you’ve taken important steps in being able to write clean, modular code and take advantage of JavaScript’s flexibility.

Let’s review what we learned in this lesson:

Abstraction allows us to write complicated code in a way that’s easy to reuse, debug, and understand for human readers

We can work with functions the same way we would any other type of data including reassigning them to new variables

JavaScript functions are first-class objects, so they have properties and methods like any object

Functions can be passed into other functions as parameters

A higher-order function is a function that either accepts functions as parameters, returns a function, or both
